# Introduction to Continuous Intergration and Continuous Deployment

The project will involve setting up a simple web application (e.g., a Node.js application) anf applying CI/CD practices using GitHub Actions. This application will have basic functionality, such as serving a static web page.

## Introduction to GitHub Actions and CI/CD Course Project

This project is designed to provide a hands-on learning experience, guiding through the essentials of automating software development processes using GitHub Actions.

### Why Is This Relevant

Imagine you are a chef in a busy restaurant. Every dish you prepare is like a piece of software code. Without a systematic approach, you might end up with orders being mixed up, dishes taking too long to prepare, or worse, the quality of the food being inconsistent. This is where a well-organised kitchen, with clear processes and automation (like having appliances that precisely time and cook part of the dishes), come into play. In software development, CI/CD is akin to this efficient kitchen. It ensures that your 'dishes' (software builds) are consistently 'cooked' (build, tested, and deployed) with precision and efficiency. By learning GitHub Actions and CI/CD, you are essentially learning how to set up and manage your high-tech kitchen in the software world, allowing you to serve 'dishes' faster, with higher quality, and with fewer 'kitchen mishaps' (bugs and deployment issues).

This mini-project will help you understand and implement these practices, making your software development process more efficient and error-free, much like a well-orchestrated kithcen. Whether you are working on personal projects, contributing to open source, or building enterprise-level applicatons, mastering CI/CD with GitHub Actions will be an invaluable skill in your development toolkit.

## Pre-requisites

1. **Basic Knowledge of Git and GitHub**

-   Understanding of version control concepts.

-   Familiarity with basic Git operations like clone, commit, push and pull.

-   A GitHub account and knowledge of repository management on GitHub.

2. **Understanding of Basic Programming Concepts**

-   Foundational programming knowledge, preferably in JavaScript, as the example project uses Node.js.

- Basic understanding of how web applications work.

3. **Familiarity with Node.js and npm**

-   Basic knowledge of Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).

-   Ability of set up with a simple Node.js project and install dependencies using npm.


4. **Text Editor or IDE**

-   A text editor or Intergrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text, or any preferred editor for writing and editing code.

5. **Local Development Environment**

-   Node.js and npm installed on the local machine.

-   Access to the command line or terminal.

6. **Internet Connection**

-   Stable internet connection to access GitHub and potentially other online resources or documentation.

7. **Basic Understanding of CI/CD Concepts**

-   General awareness of Continuous Intergration and Continuous Deployment concepts.

-   This can be part of the learning in the course, but prior knowledge is beneficial.


## Glossary

1. **Definition and Benefits of CI/CD:**

-   **Continuous Intergration (CI)** is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day

-   **Continuous Deployment (CD)** is the process of releasing software changes to production automatically and reliably.

-   **Benefits:** Faster release rate, improved develier productivity, better code quality, and enhanced customer satisfaction.

2. **Overview of the CI/CD Pipeline**

-   **CI Pipeline** typically includs steps like version control, code intergration, automated testing, and building the application.

-   **CD Pipeline** involves steps like deploying the application to a staging or production environment, and post-deploying monitoring.

-   **Tools:** Version control systems (e.g.,Git), CI/CD platforms (e.g., GitHub Actions), testing frameworks, and deployment tools.

3. **Introduction to GitHub Actions**

-   **GitHub Actions:** A CI/CD platform intergrated into GitHub, automating the build, test and deployment pipelines of your software directly within your GitHub repository.
