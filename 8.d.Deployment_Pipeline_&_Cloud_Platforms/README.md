# Deployment Pipeline & Cloud Platforms

In this project, we are going to explore how you can leverage GitHub Actions to automate the deployment process, effectively pushing your application to various cloud environments.

## The Relevance of this Project

Imagine you are a pilot of a modern airliner—a complex machine with numerous systems and components that need to work in perfect harmony. In this analogy, your codebase is the airliner, while GitHub Actions represents the sophisticated control systems that manage the aircraft's operations. Each commit, merge, or push you make is akin to adjusting the flight controls, ensuring that the aircraft navigates smoothly and efficiently to its destination—which, in our case, is the successful deployment of your application.

Deploying applications to the cloud without automation is like flying a plane manually without any advanced navigation systems—it is possible, but prone to errors, inefficiencies, and immense stress. GitHub Actions provides the automation—the autopilot, if you will—ensuring that your deployment processes are as smooth, error-free, and efficient as possible. Through this course, you will learn not just to "fly the plane," but to engage and trust your autopilot, enabling you to manage your application's journey from deployment to production with confidence and precision.

## Introduction to Deployment Pipelines

### Objectives

- Define and understand the stages of a deployment pipeline.
- Learn about different deployment strategies.

### Lesson Details

1. **Defining Deployment Stages:**
    - **Development:** Writing and testing code in a local environment.
    - **Integration:** Merging code changes to a shared branch.
    - **Testing:** Running automated tests to ensure code quality.
    - **Staging:** Deploying code to a production-like environment for final testing.
    - **Production:** Releasing the final version of your code to end-users.

2. **Understanding Deployment Strategies:**
    - **Blue-Green Deployment:** Running two production environments, only one of which serves end-users at any time.
    - **Canary Releases:** Rolling out changes to a small subset of users before full deployment.
    - **Rolling Deployment:** Gradually replacing instances of the previous version of an application with the new version.

## Automated Releases and Versioning

### Objectives

- Automate versioning in the CI/CD process.
- Create and manage software releases.

#### Automating Versioning in CI/CD

1. **Semantic Versioning:**
    - Use semantic versioning (SemVer) for your software. It uses a three-part version number, for example, `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.
    - Resource: [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)

2. **Automated Versioning with GitHub Actions:**
    - Implement automated versioning using GitHub Actions to increment version numbers automatically based on code changes.

**Example snippet for a versioning script in GitHub Actions:**

```yaml
name: Bump version and tag
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    name: Create Tag
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        # The checkout action checks out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your workflow can access it.

      - name: Bump version and push tag
        uses: anothrNick/github-tag-action@1.26.0
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          DEFAULT_BUMP: patch
        # This action automatically increments the patch version and tags the commit.
        # 'DEFAULT_BUMP' specifies the type of version bump (major, minor, patch).
```

This action will automatically increment the patch version and create a new tag each time changes are pushed to the main branch.

#### Creating and Managing Releases

1. **Automating Releases with GitHub Actions:**
    - Set up GitHub Actions to create a new release whenever a new tag is pushed to the repository.

**Example snippet to create a release:**

```yaml
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - '*'

jobs:
  build:
    name: Create Release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        # Checks out the code in the tag that triggered the workflow.

      - name: Create Release
        id: create_release
        uses: actions/create-release@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
          release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
          # This step creates a new release in GitHub using the tag name.
```

The `actions/create-release@v1` action is used to create a release on GitHub. It uses the tag that triggered the workflow to name and label the release.

### Troubleshooting and Additional Resources

- For troubleshooting GitHub Actions, the [GitHub Actions Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) is an invaluable resource.
- To resolve issues related to specific actions used in your workflow, refer to their respective repositories on GitHub or their documentation.
- For general questions and community support, the [GitHub Community Forum](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/) can be a great place to seek help.
- Remember, reading through the logs generated by GitHub Actions can provide insights into what might be going wrong with your workflow.

## Deploying to Cloud Platforms

### Objectives

- Deploy applications to popular cloud platforms using GitHub Actions.
- Configure deployment environments.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Choose a Cloud Platform**  
   Select based on your project needs:
   - AWS: [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/)
   - Azure: [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/)
   - GCP: [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)

2. **Set Up GitHub Actions for Deployment**  
   Create a workflow file in `.github/workflows/deploy-to-aws.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to AWS
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up AWS credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: us-west-2

      - name: Deploy to AWS
        run: |
          # Add your deployment script here
```
This workflow deploys your application to AWS when changes are pushed to the main branch.

3. **Configure Deployment Environments**

    - **Setting Up Environment Variables for Secrets:**  
      Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data and environment variables for non-sensitive configurations.

    - **Environment-Specific Workflows:**  
      Tailor workflows for development, staging, and production by using conditions or different workflow files.

### Helpful Resources

- [GitHub Actions Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
- [AWS GitHub Actions](https://github.com/aws-actions)
- [Azure GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Azure/actions)
- [Google Cloud GitHub Actions](https://github.com/google-github-actions)

### Troubleshooting

- Review action logs in GitHub for errors during execution.
- Ensure that your cloud platform credentials are correctly set up in GitHub Secrets.

## Conclusion

Now that you have a solid understanding of deployment pipelines and how to leverage GitHub Actions for automating deployments to cloud platforms, you are well-equipped to streamline your development workflow. By implementing automated versioning and release management, you can ensure that your software is consistently delivered with high quality and reliability.
